## Chapter 1
> [!info] **Scarcity**
> When limited resources are insufficient to satisfy unlimited wants

### Economic goods vs. Free goods
- is the good scarce?
- At zero price, does $Q_d>Q_s$?
- Is more of it preferred to less?
- Do people compete to obtain more of it?
- Are people willing to pay a cost to obtain it?
- Does production of it incur production cost?
### Positive and normative statements
- Does it involve value judgement?
- Is it refutable by facts?

## Chapter 2
### Three basic economic problems
- **What to produce**: Determining the types and quantities of goods
- **How to produce**: Determining the way of production
- **For whom to produce**: Determining the distribution criteria
### Solving the economic problems: Market mechanism
- market price is an incentive for production, as producers receive market price of goods as income.
- market price serves as a signal to inform producers of what to produce
- price determines who gets the goods, as those who are willing and able to pay the market price will get the goods.
### Private property rights
- exclusive right to use
- exclusive right to receive income from
- right to transfer
### Circular flow model
### Interest
- cost of earlier availability of resource to borrowers
- compensation for deferred consumption or investment opportunities to lenders
## Chapter 3
### Producer goods and consumer goods
Producer goods are used to produce other goods and services.
Capital goods are used to satisfy wants directly.
### Private goods and Public goods
Private goods are rival in consumption and excludable in consumption.
Public goods are non-rival in consumption and non-excludable in consumption.

> [!info] To be rival and excludable in consumption
> Rival in consumption:
> - one's consumption of the good will reduce the amount available for others
> - the good cannot be consumed by different people concurrently.
> 
> Excludable in consumption:
> - It is easy for the owner to exclude non-payers from consuming the good.
> 
> > [!tip]
> > When answering questions, "**in consumption**" cannot be omitted.
### Stages of production

>[!info] Stages of production
>Primary: Extraction of natural resources
>Secondary: turning raw materials into semi-finished or finished goods
>Tertiary: provision of services

### Factors of production
- Land: natural resources used in production
- capital: man-made resources used in production
- labour: physical or mental effort a person provides
- entrepreneurship: bearing risk and making production decision

## Chapter 4
### Measures of Labour
$$
\text{Labour supply (man-hours)}=\text{number of workers}\times\text{average working hours}
$$
$$\text{Labour productivity (Units of output per man-hour)}=\frac{\text{Total output}}{\text{Total working hours}}$$
### Mobility of Labour
#### Geographical mobility
**Geographical mobility** of labour refers to the willingness and ability of a worker to move from one location to another.

> [!info] Factors affecting geographical mobility
> - Differences in wages or job opportunities
> - Political and social factors
> - Transportation
> - Immigration and emigration policies

#### Occupational mobility
**Occupational mobility** of labour refers to the willingness and mobility of a worker to move from one occupation to another. 
> [!info] Factors affecting occupational mobility
> Personal level:
> - Wage difference (amount of income forgone, affecting opportunity cost of changing occupation)
> - Whether skills are transferable/specialised
>
> Non-personal level: 
> - Entrance requirements
> - retraining programs

### Wage payment methods
#### Time rate and Piece rate
Advantages of Time rate:
- To employers:
	- Lower cost of monitoring product quality
	- Lower cost of calculating wage
	- More stable team of workers
- To employees:
	- More stable income
Advantages of Piece rate:
- To employers:
	- Lowering monitoring cost
	- spread risk between employers and employees
- To employees:
	- Workers can earn more by working faster

> [!tip] When to adopt piece rate and time rate
> - When workers' contribution can be easily measured and quality of output can be easily monitored -> Piece rate
> - When workers' contribution is too costly to measure and high quality of work is required -> Time rate

#### Profit sharing, commissions and tips
advantages (same as piece rate):
- To employers:
	- Lowering monitoring cost
	- spread risk between employers and employees
- To employees:
	- Workers can earn more by working faster

> [!caution]
> Profit sharing, commissions and tips are not standalone wage payment methods, but rather additional sources of wage in addition to piece/time rate.

### Division of labour
Also referred to as specialisation of labour, each worker specialises in producing a particular good or a particular stage of a good.

> [!faq] How does division of labour increase productivity?
> - practice makes perfect
> - save time in training
> - save time in changing tasks
> - ensure the right person for each job
> - facilitate machanisation

#### Advantages
1. Increased labour productivity
2. Lowered cost of equipment, raised capital productivity
3. Raised living standards
#### Disadvantages
1. lower job satisfaction
2. higher risk of unemployment
3. production stages are over-interdependent
4. excessive standardisation of products
## Chapter 5
### Short-run production

A production period with both fixed and variable factors.

> [!info] Law of diminishing marginal returns
> The law states that when more units of a **variable factor** keep being added to a given quantity of **fixed factors**, the **marginal product** of the variable factor will finally decrease, holding technology constant.

### Long-run production

A production period with variable factors only.

#### Internal economies of scale
- borrow from banks at lower interest rate due to higher goodwill and more assets
- enjoy greater discount in bulk purchase of inputs
- practice a larger scope of division of labour to raise labour productivity and lower average production cost
- spread the cost of equipment over a larger output
- spread the advertising cost over a larger output
- spread the R&D cost over a larger output
#### Internal diseconomies of scale
- the firm may become too large in scale, so the management efficiency is lowered
- the market may be saturated, leading to a rise in marketing cost
- the firm may have large outstanding loans, so the cost of further borrowing increases
#### External economies of scale
- lower cost of marketing because concentration of similar firms in a place has advertising effect
- lower delivery cost from suppliers because suppliers can deliver goods in bulk to individual firms at the same time.
- lower cost of recruiting workers because workers can be attracted to the same place
- more supporting businesses available (list an example)
- transport network and other infrastructures would develop more quickly
#### External diseconomies of scale
- when an industry develops quickly, the demand for related input will increase, pushing up input prices
- the market may be saturated, leading to rise in marketing cost
