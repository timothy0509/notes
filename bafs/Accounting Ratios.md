> [!tip] Taking the average
> for some values in some of the formulas, the average balance of something is required. In these scenarios, take average of the balances of the current year and the previous year.

### Profitability
(higher is better)
$$\text{mark-up (\%)}=\frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{cost of goods sold}}$$
$$\text{gross profit ratio (\%)}=\frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{sales}}$$
$$\text{net profit ratio (\%)}=\frac{\text{net profit before tax}}{\text{sales}}$$
$$\text{return on captial employed (\%)}=\frac{\text{profit before interest and tax}}{\text{average capital employed}}$$
> [!info] Capital employed
> For sole proprietorships, capital employed refers to the capital balance.
> For partnerships, capital employed refers to the capital account balances plus the current account balances (if any).
> For limited companies, capital employed refers to non-current liabilities plus shareholder's fund (share capital)

### Liquidity
(higher is better)
$$
\text{current ratio}=\frac{\text{current assets}}{\text{current liabilities}}:1
$$
$$
\text{quick ratio}=\frac{\text{current assets}-\text{inventories}}{\text{current liabilities}}:1
$$
### Liquidity/management efficiency
(higher is better for turnovers, lower is better for collection/repayment period)
$$
\text{inventory turnover (times)}=\frac{\text{cost of goods sold}}{\text{average inventory}}
$$
$$
\text{average trade receivables collection period (days/months)}=\frac{\text{average trade receivables}}{\text{credit sales}}\times{\text{365 days or 12 months}}
$$
$$
\text{trade receivables turnover (times)}=\frac{\text{credit sales}}{\text{average trade receivables}}
$$
$$
\text{average trade payables repayment period (days/months)}=\frac{\text{average trade payables}}{\text{credit purchases}}\times{\text{365 days or 12 months}}
$$
$$
\text{trade payables turnover (times)}=\frac{\text{credit purchases}}{\text{average trade payables}}
$$
### Management efficiency
$$
\text{total assets turnover (times)}=\frac{\text{sales}}{\text{total assets}} \ (\text{higher is better})
$$
### Solvency
$$
\text{gearing ratio (\%)}=\frac{\text{non-current liabilities}+\text{preference share capital}}{\text{non-current liabilities}+\text{shareholders' fund}} \ (\text{lower is better})
$$
### Return on investment
(higher is better)
$$
\text{earnings per share (\$)}=\frac{\text{net profit after tax}-\text{preference dividend}}{\text{number of ordinary shares issued}}
$$
$$
\text{dividend cover for ordinary shares (times)}=\frac{\text{net profit after tax}-\text{preference dividend}}{\text{ordinary dividend paid}}
$$
$$
\text{price-earnings ratio}=\frac{\text{current price per ordinary share}}{\text{earnings per share}}
$$
