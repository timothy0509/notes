## Powers of $i$
$i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$
# Chapter 2: Equations of Straight Lines
## Forms of writing Equations of Straight Lines
### Point-slope form
$$
y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)
$$
where $y_1$ and $x_1$ represent the coordinates of a point lying on the straight line, and $m$ represents the slope of the straight line
### Slope-intercept form
$$
y = mx + c
$$
where $m$ represents the slope of the straight line and $c$ represents the y-intercept of the straight line.
### General Form
$$
Ax + By + C = 0 \ (A\neq0, B\neq0)
$$
where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are constants.

From the general form of a straight line equation, we can find the slope, the x-intercept and the y-intercept.
$$
\text{slope}=-\frac{A}{B}\ (B\neq0)
$$
$$
\text{x-intercept}=-\frac{C}{A}\ (A\neq0)
$$
$$
\text{y-intercept}=-\frac{C}{B}\ (B\neq0)
$$

## Quadratic Formula
To solve the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0\ (a\neq0)$, the quadratic formula can be used:
$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Discriminant and the number of roots
$$Discriminant(\Delta)=b^2-4ac$$

|            | Number of x-intercepts |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| $\Delta>0$ | 2                      |
| $\Delta=0$ | 1                      |
| $\Delta<0$ | 0                      |
## Sum and Product of roots
If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then
1. $\alpha+\beta=-\frac{b}{a}$
2. $\alpha\beta=\frac{c}{a}$

To solve questions of this type, find the sum and product of the **two required roots**.

# Chapter 4: Functions
Literally nothing to say

# Chapter 5: Quadratic Functions
1. consider a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$. If $a>0$, the graph opens upwards (has a minimum point). Otherwise ($a<0$), the graph opens downwards (has a maximum point)
2. **Vertex form** of a quadratic equation: $$y = a(x-h)^2+k$$
   $\text{Coordinates of Vertex} = (h,k)$
# Chapter 6: More about Polynomials
## Division algorithm
$$
\text{Dividend} = \text{divisor}\times\text{quotient}+\text{remainder}
$$
## Remainder Theorem
$$\text{Remainder of $f(x) \div (mx-n)$}=f(\frac{n}{m})$$
Basically putting a value of $x$ such that $mx-n=0$.
