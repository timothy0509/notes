## 5.2 Effective Measures to Improve Network Security

### Installing antivirus software

**Antivirus software** is a security tool that can scan the information in a computer and isolate infected files from other files.

- **Active mode**: provide real-time scanning, which runs in the background continuously.
- **Passive Mode**: in cases when new files enter the computer, such as inserting an external hard disk or downloading files on the Internet, it will immediately scan for virus.

To ensure security of computers:

1. Activate the antivirus software
2. Update to the newest virus definition files
3. Update antivirus
4. Update operating system

### Installing a Firewall

A firewall can monitor computer network traffic, allowing or blockking specified network traffic and therefore offering protection for the internal network.

Features of a firewall:

- Allow
- Block
- Allow all except black list
- Block all except white list

A firewall can

- filter incoming and outgoing data packets,
- block malicious network data packets from entering,
- prevent unauthorised access, and
- filter harmful messages

There are two ways to implement a firewall: **software**, or **hardware**

#### Software firewall

Software firewall is installed on the computer, and uses system resources to run.

#### Hardware firewall

Hardware firewall writes a firewall program into the chip.

|                  | Hardware firewall | Software Firewall |
| :--------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| Efficiency       | more              | less              |
| Stability        | more              | less              |
| Cost of building | Higher            | Lower             |

### Access control

A network security used to restrict users logging in to the system, and authorise their access permissions.

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user, such as biometric or password.
- **Authroisation** is the process of granting users the access right to data.
- **Accounting** is to monitor the user's access records in the system to ensure the correct use of data.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A VPN establishes a "tunnel" between a user's device and the server of a VPN provider to tranmit data. The user installs a VPN application on device. Network data packets can be encrypted, which protects the data transmitted on the Internet and prevent unauthorised access.

VPNs can also hide the real IP addresses of users, making it difficult for the website to record the user's online activities.

#### Applications of VPN

##### Intranet VPN

connect multiple long-distance LANs to become private intranets for the company.

##### Remote access VPN

employees' devices can establish an encrypted channel, and connect to the company's internal network and access internal resources and data.

### Wi-Fi wireless network security

#### Wireless encryption protocol

WEP is not good, being able to be cracked within minutes.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is good.

#### Hide Wi-Fi name

hide network name so that it cannot be automatically searched by other devices, therefore preventing unsolicited access to the network.

#### MAC Address filtering

The AP can only allow devices with the MAC addresses on the whitelist to use the Wi-Fi network, preventing unauthorised access to the network an improving network security.

#### Use public Wi-Fi carefully

If a hacker forges a wireless hotspot with the same network name and password, hacker can intercept and monitor the victim's network activities.

### Web browser security setting

In order to strengthen the web browser seuritym users should adopt the privacy and security settings listed below:

- Disable the "pop-ups and redirects" features of your web browser
- Enable the automatic update function of the web browser to ensure that software vulnerabilities would be duly removed.

## Online Privacy Threats

### Eavesdropping

### Hacking

### Social Engineering

Social engineering generally refers to a scammer's behaviour of manipulating the trust between people or the victim's greed to trick the victims into disclosing confidential personal information.

#### Baiting

Exploiting the victim's curiosity, such as using CDs or USDs as baits.

#### Quid pro quo



#### Catfishing

Fake social media accounts which will then fabricate pitiful stories to exploit the sympathy of victims and ask for donations.

#### Pretexting

Scammers will fabricate **storylines** and even pretend to be someone else to gain trust, tricking the victims into providing personal information or money.

#### Phishing

Scammer's behaviour of forging official websites and sending out many fraudulent emails or SMS.

### Spamming

**Spamming** is the behaviour of sending a large number of redundant messages through SMS messages or emails without the recipient's consent, most of which are commercial advertisements. 

The **spam** may cause the mailbox to exceed the quota limit, forcing victims to spend time checking and cleanng up unnecessary messages to free up storage. Otherwise, when the emailbox exceeds the limit, the victims will no longer be able to receive or send any messages, and may even need to pay additional fees to upgrade the storage.
